Yesterday PLOS Biology published an essay by me: [What Can Article Level Metrics Do for You?](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687). I had help from many others in writing the essay, in particular PLOS Biology editor Emma Ganley. I hope that the essay can help researchers get introduced to article-level metrics, and I am honored that the essay is part of the [PLOS Biology 10th anniversary collection](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001688).

The essay is an Open Access article published under a CC-BY license, so not only can everyone read it, but the text and figures can be freely reused, as long as proper attribution is provided, e.g. Fig. 5:

![**PLOS Biology articles: sites of recommendation and discussion**. Number of PLOS Biology research articles published until May 20, 2013 that have been recommended by F1000Prime (red) and/or mentioned in Wikipedia (blue). Taken from [doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687.g005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687.g005)](/images/venndiagram_plos_biology.png)

Although this is an essay and not a research article, I've added the data and R scripts used to generate the figures (1, 3-5) as [supporting information](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687.s001). As I [have said earlier](/2013/10/20/the-complete-article/), I think it is important that an article contains more than the text. With the open source software [R](http://www.r-project.org/) or [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) everyone can recreate the figures, and can look at the data underlying the figures in the essay. One can for example look into the data behind Fig. 5 to better understand how articles with F1000Prime recommendations **and** Wikipedia mentions differ from those **only** recommended in F1000Prime. Feel free to ask for help getting started in the comments.

Incidentally this is also my first PLOS article (my wife is way ahead of me with 5 research articles), so that I can finally look at PLOS article-level metrics as an author - after being the technical lead for this project since May 2012.
