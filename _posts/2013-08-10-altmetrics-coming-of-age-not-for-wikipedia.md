title: "Altmetrics coming of age? Not for Wikipedia"
tags: [altmetrics, wikipedia]

Ten days ago Information Standards Quarterly (ISQ) published a [special issue on altmetrics](http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2013/v25no2/). I was the guest editor for the five altmetrics articles, and in the [editorial](http://dx.doi.org/10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.01) that I titled **Altmetrics have come of age** I argued that

>We no longer need to talk about whether it is possible to reliably collect altmetrics, or whether this is valuable information that can complement citations and usage statistics.

Also in July we have seen that the National Information Standards Organization ([NISO](http://www.niso.org/home/)) was [awarded a grant](http://dx.doi.org/10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.07) by the [Sloan Foundation](http://www.sloan.org) to develop standards and recommended best practices for altmetrics.

Unfortunately Wikipedia - which is of course an important source of altmetrics information and was also mentioned in the editorial - doesn't think so. When you try to go to the [Altmetrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Altmetrics&redirect=no) page on the English Wikipedia, you get this:

![Wikipedia doesn't think Altmetrics need their own page](/images/wikipedia_redirect.png)

In other words, you are redicted to a short section on the [Impact Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor#Article_level_metrics_and_altmetrics) page. I would go and start an altmetrics (and article-level metrics) page, but with my professional involvement in altmetrics it is difficult to write from a [neutral point of view](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view), one of the core Wikipedia policies.
