This is the last [Gobbledygook](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner) post on PLOS Blogs, and at the same time the first post at the [new Github blog location](http://blog.martinfenner.org). I have been blogging at PLOS Blogs since the [PLOS Blogs Network](http://blogs.plos.org/blogosphere/) was launched in September 2010, so this step wasn't easy. But I have two good reasons.

In May 2012 I started to work as technical lead for the [PLOS Article-Level Metrics](http://article-level-metrics.plos.org) project. Although this is contract work, and I also do other things - including spending 5% of my time as clinical researcher at Hannover Medical School - this created the awkward situation that I was never quite sure whether I was blogging as Martin Fenner or as someone working for PLOS. This was all in my head, as I never had any restrictions in my blogging from PLOS. With the recent launch of the [PLOS Tech Blog](http://blogs.plos.org/tech/) there is now a good venue for the kind of topics I like to write about, and I have started to work on two posts for this new blog. 

There will always be topics for which the PLOS Tech Blog is not a good fit, and for these posts I have launched the new personal blog at Github. But the main reason for this new blog is a technical one: I'm moving away from blogging on Wordpress to writing my posts in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (a lightweight markup language), that are then transformed into static HTML pages using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). Last weekend I co-organized the workshop [**Scholarly Markdown**](https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki) together with [Stian HÃ¥klev](http://twitter.com/houshuang). A full workshop report will follow in another post, but the discussions before, at and after the workshop convinced me that **Scholarly Markdown** has a bright future and that it is time to move more of my writing to markdown. At the end of the workshop each participant suggested a [todo item](https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki/Todo-list-from-workshop) that he/she would be working on, and my todo item was "Think about document type where MD shines". Markdown might be good for writing scientific papers, but I think it really shines in shorter scientific documents that can easily be shared with others. And blog posts are a perfect fit.

The new site is work in progress. Over time I will copy over all old blog posts from PLOS Blogs, and will work on the layout as well as additional features. Special thanks to [Carl Boettiger](http://carlboettiger.info) for helping me to get started with Jekyll and Github pages.
